# New App

## Voice Conversation with AI for the Visually Impaired

New App provides a seamless voice interaction experience with AI for visually impaired users. The app leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to facilitate a conversational interface without the need for visual cues or login. The conversation text is not displayed, ensuring a pure auditory experience.

### User Journey

1. **Launching the App**
   - The user opens the app, optimized for screen readers and voice navigation.
   - No login or sign-up is required.

2. **Starting a Conversation**
   - Upon opening the app, the user is presented with a simple interface to start speaking.
   - A clearly labeled button (both visually and via screen readers) initiates voice recognition.

3. **Voice Input**
   - The user asks a question or makes a statement orally in Arabic.
   - The app uses the Web Speech API to capture and transcribe the user's voice input.

4. **Processing the Input**
   - The transcribed text is sent to the AI backend using the `createEvent` function with the `chatgpt_request` event type.
   - The AI processes the input and generates a response.

5. **Receiving and Outputting the Response**
   - The AI's textual response is converted to speech using the `text_to_speech` event type.
   - The spoken response is played back to the user.
   - The conversation text is not displayed on the screen.

6. **Auto-Listening Continuation**
   - After the AI's spoken response ends, the app automatically starts listening again.
   - The user can continue the conversation without manually initiating the listening process.

7. **Ending the Conversation**
   - The user can choose to stop the conversation at any time by pressing the stop button.
   - The app stops listening and processing input until reactivated.
