# New App

New App enables voice conversations with an AI without the need for a visual interface. The app uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to provide a seamless auditory experience, ideal for visually impaired users.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Speak to the AI in Arabic, and it responds back in Arabic.
- **Dynamic Interface**: The "End Conversation" button appears only after the conversation has started.

5. **Ongoing Conversation**:
   - After the AI finishes speaking, the app automatically starts listening again for your next input.
6. **End Conversation**:
   - The "إنهاء المحادثة" (End Conversation) button appears once the conversation has started.
